# PassportInc
Thank you for the opportunity to complete this challenge. I took some creative control when designing some of these features. For example, you can select multiple colors for the background not just blue and green. The link to the database is: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/passportinc-8091c/overview. I also did storage through Firebase as well to store the photos being used. I'm also continuing work on increasing the performance by looking into caching images. This isn't  currently implemented. All necessary features and commponents are featured on the master branch. Please let me know if you have any questions.
